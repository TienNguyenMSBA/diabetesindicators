**Machine Learning for Diabetes Risk Prediction and Insights**

This project leverages the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset to develop machine learning models for predicting diabetes risk and gaining insights into key health factors. The project involves:

- Predictive Modeling: Building a classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health indicators, with a focus on optimizing performance using algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most influential health indicators contributing to diabetes risk using feature selection techniques.
- Anomaly Detection: Detecting unusual health profiles that may signal potential outliers or unique cases using Isolation Forest.
- Risk Score Development: Designing a scoring system to classify individuals into low, medium, and high-risk categories, enabling actionable insights for public health strategies.

- The project emphasizes a data-driven approach to understanding and addressing diabetes prevalence through machine learning.
